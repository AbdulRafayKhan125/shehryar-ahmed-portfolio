                <p>I’m Shehryar Ahmed, a passionate and results-driven Software Developer with hands-on experience in
                    Java and the .NET Framework. I specialize in building scalable, efficient, anx  d maintainable
                    applications across desktop, web, and enterprise environments..</p>
                <p>Over the past few years, I’ve developed and maintained a variety of projects using technologies such as Java SE/EE, ASP.NET MVC/Core, C#, Spring Boot, Entity Framework, and SQL Server. I have a strong grasp of object-oriented programming principles, clean code practices, and design patterns that allow me to deliver robust solutions tailored to user and business needs.</p>
                <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy solving complex problems, debugging tough issues, and continuously learning new tools and technologies to improve my craft. My ability to bridge the gap between backend systems and user-focused design ensures that every solution I build not only works well but also delivers a great user experience.
</p>
<p>I thrive in collaborative environments, communicate effectively with team members and stakeholders, and bring a proactive, detail-oriented mindset to every project I work on.</p>
